**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

Alphabet Workers Union stands in support of the historic [lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing against Cisco for caste-based discrimination](https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2020/06/Cisco_2020.06.30.pdf).
This lawsuit marks the [first time in U.S. history](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/a-silicon-valley-lawsuit-reveals-caste-discrimination-is-rife-in-the-us-39773)
that any institution is being held accountable for caste-based discrimination.

Caste-oppressed workers face many barriers throughout the tech industry, including at Alphabet. [Caste is a system of oppression](https://www.equalitylabs.org/castesurvey)
analogous to racial discrimination and is rampant throughout many American institutions. We support tech workers around the world who are
[speaking up about casteism and hostile workplaces](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-11/how-big-tech-is-importing-india-s-caste-legacy-to-silicon-valley).

Alphabet’s anti-discrimination policy in India already explicitly prohibits caste-based discrimination, but that policy doesn’t apply in the US. The
[US Equal Opportunity Employment statement in Alphabet’s code of conduct](https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct/) doesn’t list caste as a protected class.
Alphabet can lead the industry and become the first technology company to add caste as a protected category globally.

Sundar Pichai made a [commitment to addressing racial equity](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/commitments-racial-equity/).
Alphabet must commit to caste equity with the same urgency. Recognizing and addressing caste-based discrimination will benefit Alphabet, its workers, and its users worldwide.

Caste-oppressed workers have the right to a safe workplace and this is why we have committed to this fight. The fight for the civil rights of caste-oppressed people is a workers’ fight.
Caste should be recognized as a [protected class by the federal government](https://subscriptlaw.com/protected-classes/) and be included in anti-harassment policies within our industry.
