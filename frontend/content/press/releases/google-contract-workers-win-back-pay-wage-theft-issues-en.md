**(Morristown, NJ)**—Nearly a dozen Google contract workers won back tens of thousands of dollars in backpay owed to them by Artech, a subcontractor of Accenture, which
is a major subcontractor of Google. Workers discovered a discrepancy between their pay stubs and the amount designated by Accenture to be paid directly to Artech
employees. Workers were losing $5 to $10 dollars an hour, resulting in thousands of dollars of unpaid backpay. Currently there are still some workers waiting to
receive the over ten thousand they are owed in backpay. The lack of pay transparency is an issue rampant amongst temporary, vendor and contract workers at
Google and Google must do more to ensure all workers are able to clearly understand their pay floor and salary raises opportunities. 

“I work to create rich media for Google Help Center content viewed by millions of users, our team also gets tapped to some pretty high visibility
internal projects and content strategy. Many of our workers are subcontracted through Artech to staff Accenture’s contract with Google—creating a 3-tiered employment
system. At about 6 months we will be rolled on to Accenture Flex. For me, it felt like a promotion to a two-tiered system.  It was during my transition to
Flex that I asked for a raise and discovered that Accenture was supposedly paying $5 more for me all along. Artech admitted fault but it took many months to get
the over $3000 I had earned,” said Laura Greene, former Visual Designer at Artech and member of the Alphabet Workers Union - Communications Workers of America
(AWU-CWA).

Artech is an IT staffing firm that prides itself on being the [largest women-owned IT company in the US](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226564). Workers are
hired by Artech, usually for 6 months, to work with Accenture in creating written and visual content that is published for customer and internal use like the Google
Help Center. After 6 months, workers are typically hired by the Accenture Flex team to continue their work for Google. It is during this transition period that most
workers discovered that they had been victims of wage theft. 

“After working at Artech for X months, developing critical content for Google users and full-time employees, I learned from other impacted workers that I was owed
over ten thousand dollars in backpay. No Google worker, whether a full-time employee or contract worker should be victims of wage theft. Google must do more to hold
contractors accountable to their workers and establish greater transparency around pay scales in order to ensure all workers know what they should be receiving and
can advocate for the quality wages they deserve,” said Guy Mylius, a Google contractor with Artech. 

Artech has several hundred employees in the Philippines, but these workers have been protected from wage theft thanks to local pay parity laws. In California, Senate
Bill 1162 was introduced to increase pay transparency and pay data reporting. The Bill would require employers to submit pay data reports to the Department of Fair
Employment and Housing and include the median and mean hourly rate for employees categorized by race, ethnicity, and sex within specified job categories. It would
also require California employers to proactively provide pay ranges in job postings. While this would not protect all Alphabet temporary, vendor, and contract
workers across the globe, the bill is a key step forward to ensuring all workers receive the wages they are entitled to. 

“Google tries to distance themselves from the issues contractors face by claiming that the issue is between the impacted employees and a specific contractor. What
Google refuses to acknowledge is the fact that contractors base their policies off of the standards Google sets and enforces. Google should not have to wait until
SB 1162 passes in California to publicly post pay ranges for job postings and pay data reporters to ensure that all workers are aware of the pay they should be 
eceiving and thus better able to negotiate for the wages they deserve,” said Parul Koul software engineer at Google and Executive Chair of the Alphabet Workers
Union - Communications Workers of America (AWU-CWA).

The ongoing effort to secure Artech workers the backpay they are owed follows a growing effort by workers to tackle Google’s two-tiered employment system. Last
week, Google Maps contract workers with Cognizant, based in the Google office in Bothell, WA, informed management that they planned to go on strike due to the
unsafe working conditions imposed by the June 6 Return to Office (RTO) date. Shortly after, workers received an email that they had received a 90 day extension.
In [November 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/google-workers.html) Google datacenter contractors came together to win back the pandemic bonuses
they had been promised. Within a few short weeks workers successfully won back thousands of dollars in pandemic bonuses from Modis management. These ongoing efforts
underscore the growing organizing momentum within tech and the power of wall-to-wall union models like AWU-CWA that allow all workers to join together, regardless of
employment classification, to secure concrete wins for workers.

Workers across Google and Alphabet are taking a stand against the growing use and abuse of temp, vendor, and contractor workers that enforces Google’s two-tiered
workplace. Other temporary, vendor, and contractor workers impacted by similar issues of wage theft and the lack of pay transparency at Alphabet should reach out
to the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA to be connected with workers organizing around these issues.
