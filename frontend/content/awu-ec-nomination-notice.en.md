## Petitions

**Petitions Available: *July 20, 2022.*** A member in good standing may request a petition by email to the AWU subcommittee of the Election Committee [Samuel Sandeen, Eric Willisson, and Emily Chang] at elections@alphabetworkersunion.org. You may request a petition for yourself or any AWU member in good standing. In your email request for a petition, you must include:

- your name, email address, home address, phone number, the name of the nominee and the position sought; 
- If you are requesting a petition to nominate another member, please also provide any contact information you may have for that potential nominee so that we may advise them of the acceptance requirements. 

The Election Committee will inform requestors whether they are in good standing and send the petition by email as soon as practicable but not later than 48 hours after the request.

**Petition Submission Deadline: *4 PM PST, August 4th, 2022.*** Petitions must be submitted in a single email to elections@alphabetworkersunion.org. Petitions not received by the deadline and/or partial petitions will not be considered.

Petition Requirements: For this election, the CWA Local 1400 petition process as described in the bylaws has been modified to ensure members have a reasonable opportunity to nominate candidates, given the current COVID-19 health concerns and limited number of members in workplaces.

Petition signatures must be those of members in good standing (see below for definition).

For this election, a petition “signature” is either:

1. a hand-written signature and printed name on the nomination petition
1. an email from a member that includes their name, the name of the person they are nominating, and the position they are nominating for (printed)

**Nominees for Executive Chair must be members in good standing as of July 1, 2022.** Petitions for these officer positions will require **10 signatures** of members in good standing of CWA Local 1400.

**Nominees for Finance Chair, Recording Chair, Organizing Chair and the Communications Chair must be members in good standing as of July 1, 2022.** Petitions for these officer positions will require **5 signatures** of members in good standing.

Verification of Petitions: Petitions and eligibility of candidates will be verified by the Election Committee on August 8, 2022, at 9:00am PST. All candidates and/or observers are invited to attend. All nominees must accept or decline their nominations. The Election Committee will attempt to contact all nominees, advise them of their nomination(s), and request that the nominee confirm acceptance by email or other written confirmation. A nominee who does not provide written acceptance of a nomination by August 10th will not appear on the ballot. Candidates may only be on the ballot for one position.

Please direct questions to the AWU Election Committee Chairperson Samuel Sandeen at elections@alphabetworkersunion.org. Any member may contact the Election Committee to find out who has requested a nomination petition, the name of the potential nominee, and the position being nominated.

## What is "good standing"?

A member is generally in good standing if that member has signed a membership application card, has been accepted, has had voluntary dues paid as of July 1, 2022, has not voluntarily withdrawn from membership, and has not been sent a notice that their membership was terminated. Good standing terminates when a member resigns from employment with Alphabet. Termination and resignation of membership are governed by the CWA Constitution, Article V, Section 4 and the Local 1400 By-Laws, Section 4.
