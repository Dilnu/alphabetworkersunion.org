## Black History Month Union Movie Night

As part of Black History Month, we will be screening [At The River I Stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzRUwwRQzVc&ab_channel=CaliforniaNewsreel), a powerful hour-long documentary recounting the 1968 Memphis sanitations workers' strike, and the two eventful months that led to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the climax of the Civil Rights Movement. The screening will be followed by a short discussion.
 Invite your co-workers! AWU Members and non-members are both welcome.
Register for the event

[Register to attend Friday, February 18th, 2022 7 pm ET / 4 pm PT](https://airtable.com/shrBIdrstW1s7Z1GH).

## About union days

Union days are open to all workers at Alphabet. We welcome TVCs, FTEs, union members, and non-members who are interested in learning more about workplace issues. Union days are periodic events where we discuss ongoing campaigns, workplace concerns, organizing opportunities, and other ways to get involved to improve Alphabet. All are welcome!

## Watch previous union days

Previously recorded union days are added here. However, the recording can never replace the real thing. We record the presentations, but in order to enable workers to speak freely, the breakout room discussions and Q & As aren't recorded. The best way to experience a Union Day is to attend so that you don't miss out on the great conversations!
