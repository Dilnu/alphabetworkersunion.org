AWU hosts monthly office hours that are open to all Alphabet TVCs. Nonmembers are welcome to attend, and worker organizers, both TVC and FTE, will be facilitating the session. We'll share the latest news on our workplace organizing efforts, but more importantly this is an open forum for everyone. Come share your workplace concerns, challenges, and questions of any kind.

## About union days

Union days are open to all workers at Alphabet. We welcome TVCs, FTEs, union members, and non-members who are interested in learning more about workplace issues. Union days are periodic events where we discuss ongoing campaigns, workplace concerns, organizing opportunities, and other ways to get involved to improve Alphabet. All are welcome!

## Watch previous union days

Previously recorded union days are added here. However, the recording can never replace the real thing. We record the presentations, but in order to enable workers to speak freely, the breakout room discussions and Q & As aren't recorded. The best way to experience a Union Day is to attend so that you don't miss out on the great conversations!
