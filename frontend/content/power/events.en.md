## Union day: #DropTheDeadnames campaign update

In just 18 days after launching the campaign, Phares Lee was able to resolve workplace issues that were not addressed in his 3 years working before having a union. 

At our next union day, he will tell his story and lead a discussion about the importance of union activism to secure LGBTQ+ rights at work.

At this event, we will discuss:

- What lessons can be learned from the drop the deadnames campaign?
- What is a union and why is building a strong union, one of the most effective ways to ensure LGBTQA+ rights in the workplace?
- What still needs to change in your workplace?
- What still needs to be done? Where do we go from here?
