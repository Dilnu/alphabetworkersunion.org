## Powerful together

We are the workers of Google, Alphabet, its sister companies, and the contracting and vendor firms they employ. We build the products, maintain the offices, and serve the food that enable our success. We connect our users to the world, design and build our hardware, help businesses use our services, and respond to our users’ feedback.

**Without you and your labor, there is no Alphabet.**

Many workers feel powerless while leadership professes that they empower people. Workers have tried to influence Alphabet from within, only to be ignored, harassed, and retaliated against. Leadership continues to ignore us and silence us to ensure their success and bonuses.

Alphabet leadership is ready to put:

- Profit before users,
- Profit before workers,
- Profit before being a force for good in the world.

We trusted our leaders to wield power based on our shared core [values]({{< ref "principles/mission-statement" >}}), but time and experience have shown that our trust was misplaced.

We are retaliated against when we:

- Object to executive decisions on moral grounds,
- Report the discrimination, harassment, and abuse that we suffer,
- Speak up about the potential damage our products can cause,
- Expose having worse working conditions than their peers doing the same work,
- Demand exemplary working conditions for all Alphabet workers,
- Object to forcing folks into a second-class status as temps, vendors, or contractors.

Reclaim your power, hold leadership accountable, and help us improve Alphabet for everyone.

## The stakes couldn’t be higher

Decisions made within Alphabet are high-stakes and their consequences have long-lasting impact.

The potential risks of our products impact you, your family, and your communities:

- YouTube serves as a platform to learn new skills, but it also serves as a radicalization engine.
- AI models have the power to detect diabetes from a picture of your eyes, but they also entrench bias and discrimination.
- Our products create more efficient businesses, but they also create efficiencies in government entities violating human rights.

Your work is so powerful that it reaches the life of billions daily: storing their emails and files, helping them find their way, and giving them access to the world’s information. We face major challenges and the world’s inequitable distribution of resources has never been more obvious.

You probably joined the tech industry to help solve these problems, but the margin for error is vanishing, and, recently, workers and users have noticed how Alphabet:

- Violates users’ privacy to obtain data,
- Deprecates services users rely on to force them to use more profitable alternatives,
- Launches products with outdated and exploitative business models.

Reclaim your power and grab a seat at the table to make the decisions together.

## Fixing things from within

Our executives shifted their priorities. Short-term financial gains and executive convenience now trump any long-term negative impacts of our services. Our work at Alphabet is analyzing complex problems and identifying innovative and effective solutions, but leadership demands that we follow them blindly, even if it means making problems worse or relying on outdated and ineffective solutions.

Leadership’s actions are evidence of the shift in priorities:

- Excluding us from the decision-making processes,
- Firing those who speak up against predatory and exploitative practices,
- Retaliating against workers who are warning against potential downsides of our products,
- Crunching us to meet unrealistic arbitrary deadlines,
- Selling our products to government entities that violate human rights across the world.

Alphabet won’t allow you to use your insights to ensure that we all live up to our founding promise: **Don’t Be Evil.**

When leadership suppresses our voices, it is impossible for Alphabet workers to fix things from within, and Alphabet becomes a company that does evil for profit. A new structure is needed at our company to ensure that workers are appropriately heard.

Remember:

- The workers before us that spoke truth to power and paid the price for doing so.
- Evil starts with the exploitation of the most vulnerable, but it never ends there.
- People Ops (HR) and leadership protect the company and their success: not workers.
- ERGs can’t make the systemic changes needed to help the most vulnerable groups at Alphabet.
- You are not alone.

Reclaim your power.
