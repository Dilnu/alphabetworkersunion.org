_As updated by Special Assembly, 5/2/2021_.

## Purpose

This document summarizes the rules changes passed by an Assembly or other authorized body. As per Robert’s Rules of Order, chapter 10, the wording of the motion as passed is fixed—this document is an effort by the Rules Committee to put the motions which passed in the clearest and most succinct possible terms, for ease of reference and understanding.

## Rule 1. Code of conduct

AWU-CWA members must abide by the [code of conduct](https://alphabetworkersunion.org/principles/code-of-conduct/), incorporated herein by reference.

The code of conduct can only be updated in the same manner as these rules. The Trust and Safety Committee must maintain the current version of the document and ensure that all members are promptly made aware of updates.

### Relevant articles

Article 17, Section 1 delegates authority over the conduct of AWU business to the rules.

## Rule 2. Additional Executive Council chairs

In addition to the chairs specified in the articles, the Executive Council contains
(a) The Communications Chair.
(b) The Organizing Chair.

In addition to the responsibilities specified in the articles, the Executive Council chairs have the following responsibilities:
(a) The Communications Chair is appointed as chair of the Communications Committee.
(b) The Organizing Chair is appointed as chair of the Organizing Committee.

### Relevant articles

Article 10, Section 1 delegates the definition of additional Executive Council Chairs to the rules.

## Rule 3. Additional delegates to the Steering Committee

Temps, Vendors, and Contractors (TVCs) will compose at least one third of the Steering Committee’s membership.

In the event that the fraction of TVCs on the Steering Committee falls below the ratio specified in Section 1, the TVC Workplace Unit (established by act of the Special Assembly, May 2, 2021) may elect additional delegates to the Steering Committee in order to create the desired ratio.

At the request of the TVC Workplace Unit, the Elections Committee, in coordination with the Membership Committee and Steering Committee Chair, will provide the maximum number of delegates able to be elected.

These special elections may be conducted at most twice per calendar year. They may result in the election of fewer than the maximum number of delegates.

### Relevant articles

Article 16, Section 2(a)(5) delegates the definition of additional delegates to the Steering Committee to the rules.

## Rule 4. Rules relating to stewards

### Part 1. Definition of manager

For the purposes of this rule, a manager is a person with at least one direct report, who has authority to impose consequences on that report for work performance. The following exclusions apply:

(a) Interns are not considered reports.
(b) “Temporary” or “rotator” reports are not considered reports. These include Engineering Residency participants, ITRP participants, and similar “temporary reporting” structures/rotations.
(c) Dotted-line reports are not considered reports.

### Part 2. Assignment to squads

In order to maintain consistent relationships within their workplace unit, stewards are generally expected to have a number of assigned members from their workplace unit for whom they are specifically responsible. This group is called a “squad”, and will generally contain at least four (4) members. Specific assignment of stewards to squad members is the responsibility of the Workplace Unit Chair, subject to the following constraints:

(a) A member must not be assigned to a steward who is in the member’s reporting chain, even if the steward does not qualify as a “manager” according to Section 1.
(b) A non-manager member must not be assigned to a steward who is a manager.
(c) A member below L8 (or equivalent, for non-ladder-based Bets or companies) must not be assigned to a steward who is above L8 (or equivalent).
(d) No new members should be assigned to a steward who is terminated, including if they are contesting termination.

If a member’s employment status changes, and the changes create a violation of these assignment rules, the Workplace Unit Chair must remedy the violation within four (4) weeks.

### Part 3. Additional requirements of stewards

(a) Stewards must be active employees of Alphabet or its contractor companies, with access to some form of work communication. In the event that a steward is terminated, including in cases where that termination is contested, the steward must resign within four (4) weeks.

(b) A steward who anticipates a change in status that would affect their squad assignments (as defined in Section 3) must report that change to their Workplace Unit Chair at least 2 weeks in advance of the change. If such a change in status change happens unexpectedly, the steward must report it to the Workplace Unit Chair as soon as is practical.

(c) There are no skill requirements for being a steward. No such requirement may prevent an otherwise-eligible member from being a steward.

### Part 4. Right to change squads

Any member has a right to be reassigned to a different squad at any time, by requesting reassignment from the Chair of the Workplace Unit. The Workplace Unit Chair must reassign them, and may not assign them to the steward whose squad they are leaving in the future. 

If no other stewards are available, the Workplace Unit Chair should consider running new elections. If an election is infeasible, or if there are no volunteers, then the Workplace Unit Chair must contact the Executive Council, which, under these circumstances, may assign the member to a steward from outside the workplace unit.

### Part 5. Workplace unit right to override steward rules

The above steward rules may be overridden by majority vote of any workplace unit, in the same way that Article 14, Section 3(a) permits a workplace unit to approve alternative mechanisms for steward selection. The overriding workplace unit is required to keep a written record of any such overrides and must submit the record to the Recording Chair.

### Relevant articles

Article 14 discusses stewards in detail and delegates certain definitions and additions to the rules.

## Rule 5: Requirements of former full-time employees

### Part 1: Definition of former members

A former member is:
(a) a former full-time employee
(b) who no longer works at Alphabet
(c) who was an AWU member in good standing at the time they left Alphabet.

A former full-time employee who has been terminated and is contesting their termination is not considered a former member for the purposes of this rule, until such time as they stop contesting their firing. At that time, they become a former member.

[The 5/2/2021 assembly decided against creating rules related to ‘former member’ status of TVCs, and referred the question to the membership committee for further study.]

### Part 2: Restrictions for former members

(a) Former members cannot hold elected positions. They may serve in an acting capacity while a replacement is being elected, subject to other rules pertaining to their position.
(b) Former members are generally not permitted to be committee members or working group members, with exceptions made subject to Membership Committee policy.
(c) Former members are never allowed to vote in committees.
(d) Members holding elected positions must notify the Elections Committee within two weeks after they become former members.
(e) At their discretion, the Membership Committee may decide to have the former member step down without holding an election (in the case of stewards, for example).
(f) Former members should defer to and center full members in their work.

### Relevant articles

Article 7, Section 3 states: Members in good standing who resign or otherwise leave employment may be allowed to participate in AWU activities as decided by the AWU. Such individuals are not required to pay dues and are not entitled to vote.

Article 11, Section 5 contains special rules regarding vacancies in the Executive Council, which this rule does not override.
